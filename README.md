# Potato-Disease-Detection-using-Image-Processing
Real-time Potato disease identification using Python

**The project includes following procedure:**  
• Collecting Dataset of different defective 
Potatoes.  
• Label the defective parts  
• Train the module for custom object detection  
• Program the ESP32 Wi-Fi camera to transmit 
real time video to laptop/PC  
• Writing the code to get input of ESP32  
• Combine the object detection module and 
video input  
• Use the module to identify diseases

Sprouted Potatos Detected 

**The main objectives of this project are :**  
• To detect potato diseases in real time as most 
of methods rely on images taken.  
• This prototype can lead industries in reducing 
human efforts and save time.  
• Give valuable feedback to farmers regarding 
diseases and also providing remedies to this 
diseases.
